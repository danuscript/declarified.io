                    JavaScript is one of many programming languages with <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function"><strong>first-class
                            functions</strong></a>, which means
                    that
                    functions can be treated like any other variable. You can assign a function to be the value of a
                    variable, a function can be the return value of another function, and most importantly: you can pass
                    a function as an argument into another function. This is the central idea behind callbacks and
                    higher-order functions.
                    <br><br>
                    It's not immediately obvious that functions in JavaScript are the same as other variables, since the
                    traditional syntax for declaring a function can look a lot different from the syntax for declaring
                    other variables.
                    <br><br>
                    Your average variable in JavaScript can be declared with the keyword <code>const</code>.
                    <pre><code>const foo = 42;
const bar = 'Hello, world!';</code></pre>
                    If this variable needs to be reassigned or redeclared at any point after declaration, then it should
                    be declared
                    with the keyword <code>let</code> instead.
                    <pre><code>let foo = false;
foo = true;</code></pre>
                    Functions on the other hand are traditionally declared using the <code>function</code> keyword.
                    There's no
                    assignment operator (<code>=</code>) to be found.
                    <pre><code>function foo() {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}</code></pre>
                    In the code snippet above, <code>foo</code> is a variable just as it was in the prior examples. In
                    this case, <code>foo</code>'s value is
                    the function object itself. To see what we mean, let's first <code>console.log</code> the value
                    of a normal
                    variable.
                    <pre><code>const foo = 42;
console.log(<code>foo</code>); // -> 42</code></pre>
                    We've initialized a variable with the label <code>foo</code> and assigned it a value of the number
                    42. When we
                    <code>console.log(foo)</code>, we see that its value is 42, as expected.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, let's take our function example from before.
                    <pre><code>function foo() {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}</code></pre>
                    If we <code>console.log</code> the evaluated result of invoking this function, the output will be
                    straightforward:
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo()); // -> 'Hello, world!'</code></pre>
                    But instead of invoking this function like <code>foo()</code>, let's just log the value of
                    <code>foo</code> itself.
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo);
/*
logs the following:
function foo() {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}
*/</code></pre>
                    When a function is declared with the <code>function</code> keyword, it creates a variable with the
                    label you gave
                    that function. The value assigned to this label is the function object you declared. So in our
                    example, we've declared a function with the label <code>foo</code>. When we <code>console.log</code>
                    the value of the variable
                    <code>foo</code>, we see that this value is the function object <code>foo</code>.
                    <br><br>
                    The exact output from this
                    <code>console.log</code> may differ depending on your JavaScript runtime environment, but the
                    process is the
                    same. For example, your output may not have any line breaks.
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo); // -> function foo() { return 'Hello, world!'; }</code></pre>
                    Alternatively, your output may even look like this:
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo); // -> [Function: foo]</code></pre>
                    The outcome is the same: <code>foo</code> is a variable with the value of the function object
                    that we wrote.
                    To see this object, we could invoke the <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString"><code>toString()</code>
                        function method</a> on <code>foo</code> and log the result.
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo.toString());
/*
logs the following:
'function foo() {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}'
*/</code></pre>
                    With functions being nothing more than special objects, they don't just have methods like
                    <code>toString()</code>; they have other properties as well. Much like an array's
                    <code>array.length</code>, functions
                    have properties such as <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name"><code>function.name</code></a>.
                    Let's look at foo's name property.
                    <pre><code>console.log(foo.name); // -> 'foo'</code></pre>
                    So, as each <code>console.log</code> has demonstrated, variables in JavaScript can take many forms.
                    A variable
                    could be a number, a variable could be a boolean, or a variable could be a function, among other
                    possibilities. You can pass functions around from one part of your code to another just as easily as
                    you can with any other variable. Keeping this in mind, callbacks and higher-order functions are much
                    easier to reason about.

                    <h2 id="function-syntax">Function Syntax</h2>
                    With the myriad of functions you're going to encounter in this guide and beyond, it's important to
                    recognize the different forms that a function can take. So far, the functions we've looked at have
                    used <strong>function declaration</strong> syntax. Here are some examples of functions declared this
                    way:
                    <pre><code>function divideByTwo(number) {
  return number / 2;
}
console.log(divideByTwo(4)); // -> 2

function concatWithS(string) {
  return `${string}s`;
}
console.log(concatWithS('apple')); // -> 'apples'

function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}
console.log(addNumbers(1, 2)); // -> 3</code></pre>
                    The purpose of these functions and their return values are straightforward. We see from its function
                    definition that <code>divideByTwo</code> has one parameter: <code>number</code>. Inside its function
                    body, <code>divideByTwo</code> uses
                    the division operator to return a value equivalent to <code>number</code> divided by two. Similarly,
                    <code>concatWithS</code>
                    and <code>addNumbers</code> use a template literal and the addition operator respectively in order
                    to return
                    their desired output values based off of the data passed in as input.
                    <br><br>
                    From these examples, we can derive a simple function declaration template for illustration purposes:
                    <pre><code>// function declaration
function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
  return returnValue;
}

// function invocation
name(argument1, argument2);</code></pre>
                    All function declarations follow this format. First comes the <code>function</code> keyword,
                    followed by the name
                    of the function. The function's name is immediately followed by a list of its input parameters. The
                    example in our template has two, but functions can be defined with zero, one, or any other number of
                    parameters. After this comes the opening curly brace of the function's body. Between that and the
                    closing curly brace, we can include a list of statements for our function to execute. In most cases,
                    our list of statements will end with a return statement: the <code>return</code> keyword followed by
                    any value
                    that we wish to return. The return value will often be influenced by the value of the function's
                    inputs.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides defining a function with a traditional declaration, the bottom of our template shows us an
                    <strong>invocation</strong> of that function. A function is invoked when its name is used and
                    followed by parens, in
                    any context other than the initial function definition. Within those parens, we include any
                    arguments we wish to pass into our function as input. These arguments are imported as the value of
                    the function's parameters, and then the statements inside the function's body are executed.
                    <br><br>
                    In our
                    example, <code>argument1</code> will be imported as the value of <code>parameter1</code>, and
                    <code>argument2</code> will likewise be
                    matched to <code>parameter2</code>. If these parameters were used inside the function body, then for
                    that
                    specific call those parameters would have the value of those arguments within that body. Once the
                    function reaches and evaluates its return statement, the code stops running and the return value
                    will be passed back to the initial context from which the function was called. So, <code>name(argument1, argument2)
                    </code> has an evaluated result of <code>returnValue</code>.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking back at our functions <code>divideByTwo</code>, <code>concatWithS</code>, and
                    <code>addNumbers</code> as well as their invocations,
                    it's clear to see how the code runs through the lens of our function declaration template. However,
                    what if the functions looked like this instead?
                    <pre><code>const divideByTwo = function (number) {
  return number / 2;
};
console.log(divideByTwo(4)); // -> 2

const concatWitihS = function (string) {
  return `${string}s`;
};
console.log(concatWithS('apple')); // -> 'apples'

const addNumbers = function (number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
};
console.log(addNumbers(1, 2)); // -> 3</code></pre>

                    These are not function declarations, these are <strong>function expressions</strong>. More
                    specifically, in each of
                    these examples we have declared a constant and assigned it the value of an anonymous function
                    expression. It's important to distinguish between both sides of the assignment operator when it
                    comes to initializing variables with function expressions as values. Much like the 42 in
                    <code>const foo = 42</code>, the right side of this assignment in the examples above is just a
                    value. Just like 42 by itself
                    is not declaring anything, the function expression by itself is not declaring anything either,
                    unlike a function declaration. That is why there is a declaration happening on the left, using the
                    const keyword. Like any other value, a function expression doesn't always have to be assigned to a
                    label using <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>. It can also be passed into a function as an
                    argument, or returned from a
                    function as a return value.
                    <br><br>
                    You may have also noticed the anonymity of these functions; there is no name following the
                    <code>function</code>
                    keyword. While function declarations do need a name, it's optional for function expressions. In the
                    event that no name is used but the functixon is assigned to a variable, then the name can be
                    inferred
                    from the variable's label. So in the above example, <code>divideByTwo.name === 'divideByTwo'</code>,
                    despite the
                    function expression itself not having a name. However, functions used in function expressions need
                    not always be anonymous, so this is also valid code:
                    <pre><code>// named function expression assigned to constant
const divideByTwo = function divider(number) {
  return number / 2;
};

console.log(divideByTwo.name) // -> divider</code></pre>

                    Let's use all of this knowledge to come up with a template for function expressions.
                    <pre><code>// anonymous function expression assigned to constant
const name = function (parameter1, parameter2) {
  return returnValue;
};

// function invocation
name(argument1, argument2);</code></pre>

                    You will encounter function expressions, both anonymous and named, throughout this guide and beyond.
                    You can think of them as being values that are functions; much like 42 is a value that is a number,
                    and "Hello, world!" is a value that is a string. Like these other values, function expressions will
                    often be assigned to variables using <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, and they can be passed
                    into other functions and
                    returned from other functions as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides function declarations and traditional function expressions, there is another type of syntax
                    you'll commonly see when it comes to writing functions: <strong>arrow function expressions</strong>.
                    This is the most
                    commonly used syntax that you'll see in this guide:
                    <pre><code>const divideByTwo = (number) => number / 2;
console.log(divideByTwo(4)); // -> 2

const concatWithS = (string) => `${string}s`;
console.log(concatWithS('apple')); // -> 'apples'

const addNumbers = (number1, number2) => number1 + number2;
console.log(addNumbers(1, 2)); // -> 3</code></pre>

                    In each example above, we have declared a constant and assigned it the value of an arrow function
                    expression. There seems to be quite a lot missing at first when compared to a traditional function
                    expression: the function keyword, the curly braces, and the <code>return</code> keyword are nowhere
                    to be found.
                    However, it's important to note that an arrow function is just a special kind of anonymous function
                    expression, with different syntax. The list of parameters is still there, and the return value
                    is being returned implicitly.
                    <br><br>
                    All of the example functions we've been using so far have only had one statement within their body,
                    as opposed to a longer list. If your function is like those examples and contains just a single
                    expression, then arrow functions allow you to forgo the curly braces for the body, and leave out the
                    <code>return</code> keyword. The expression after the arrow will be returned automatically; this is
                    called
                    <strong>implicit return</strong>.
                    <pre><code>const foo = () => 'Hello, world!';

console.log(foo()); // -> 'Hello, world!'
// the string was returned implicitly</code></pre>

                    However, many functions will have multiple statements to execute before a return is reached. If
                    there is more than one statement within your function, then your arrow function will need curly
                    braces to contain those statements. Similarly, if your code contains something that is not an
                    expression that can be returned, such as an <code>if</code> statement or a variable declaration,
                    then curly braces
                    are needed for that situation as well. The return will not be implicit if curly braces are present,
                    so the <code>return</code> keyword must be used if you wish to return a value, just like any other
                    function with
                    curly braces.
                    <pre><code>// curly braces are needed for this function 
const game = (score) => {
  if (score >= 100) return 'You won!';
  else if (score >= 50) return 'Almost there...';
  else return 'Try again next time!';
};</code></pre>

                    It's also worth noting that when an arrow function has exactly one parameter, the parens around that
                    parameter can be omitted. For consistency, the code in this guide will always use parens for an
                    arrow function's parameters, but it's important to know that both of the following functions work
                    the
                    same way:
                    <pre><code>const affirmation = name => `Great work, ${name}!`;
const affirmation2 = (name) => `You've got this, ${name}!`;</code></pre>

                    With all of this in mind, let's look at a template for writing arrow function expressions. We'll
                    also include the templates for the previous syntax as well, so you can easily see the differences
                    and similarities.
                    <pre><code>// arrow function expression assigned to a constant
const name = (parameter1, parameter2) => returnValue;

// anonymous function expression assigned to constant
const name = function (parameter1, parameter2) {
return returnValue;
};

// function declaration
function name(parameter1, parameter2) {
return returnValue;
}

// function invocation
name(argument1, argument2);</code></pre>

                    As you can see, these functions differ in appearance, but they're all invoked the same way. There
                    are differences under the hood when it comes to functions written using these different methods; in
                    some situations one kind of function is preferable over another, and in other situations certain
                    kinds of functions should be avoided altogether. However, within the scope of this guide, all of the
                    aforementioned function syntax will appear interchangeably, so make sure you're comfortable
                    recognizing and writing function declarations, function expressions, and arrow function expressions.
                    With this knowledge, you'll always be able to analyze your code and know exactly what each line is
                    doing at any given time.

                    <h2 id="callback-structure">Callback Structure</h2>
                    Now that we're familiar with the nature of functions and the various syntax that we'll encounter,
                    let's look at how this all fits into this guide's main focus: callbacks and higher-order functions.
                    We know that a variable can be a function, and that variables can be passed into functions as
                    arguments. So what happens when you pass a function into a different function as an argument?

                    In order to see this in action, let's start with an example problem that calls for a <strong>higher-order function:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Write a function called <code>thrice</code> that accepts two arguments: a callback function, and a value.
                        Your
                        <code>thrice</code> function should invoke the callback three times, following this logic:
                        <br><br>
                        On the first invocation, <code>thrice</code> should pass its input value into the callback as an argument.
                        <br><br>
                        On the second invocation of the callback, <code>thrice</code> should pass in the result of the first
                        invocation.
                        <br><br>
                        On the third invocation, <code>thrice</code> should pass in the result of the second invocation.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, after these three function calls, <code>thrice</code> should return the result of the third
                        invocation.
                        <br><br>
                        Example 1:<br>
                        <strong>Input</strong><br>
                        <code>callback = (number) => number / 2</code><br>
                        <code>value = 8</code><br>
                        <strong>Output</strong><br>
                        <code>thrice(callback, value) === 1</code>
                        <br><br>
                        Example 2:<br>
                        <strong>Input</strong><br>
                        <code>callback = (string) => `${string}s`</code><br>
                        <code>value = 'cat'</code><br>
                        <strong>Output</strong><br>
                        <code>thrice(callback, value) === 'catsss'</code>
                    </blockquote>
                    This challenge's prompt is asking us to implement a function that simulates running a callback three
                    times. Using our example functions from earlier, passing in <code>divideByTwo</code> and the number 8 should give
                    us a result of 1, which is what happens if you divide 8 by 2 three times. Similarly, passing in
                    <code>concatWithS</code> and the string 'cat' should give us 'catsss', since that's what happens when you add an
                    's' to 'cat' three times. Let's start by writing out our function body:
                    <pre><code>const thrice = (callback, value) => {
  // TODO
};</code></pre>

                    We now have a function that accepts the parameters specified in the prompt. Next, let's implement
                    the core idea: repeating an action three times. The most straightforward method for this is a simple
                    for loop.
                    <pre><code>const thrice = (callback, value) => {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i += 1) {
    // TODO
  }
};</code></pre>

                    Now, let's tackle the trickier part. On each iteration, we're going to invoke the callback. The
                    argument that's passed into this callback should first have a value equal to the one passed into
                    <code>thrice</code>. Before our loop starts, let's initialize a variable with this value, called <code>result</code>. Then,
                    within the loop, we'll pass that variable into the callback, and save the output of that invocation
                    to a new variable called <code>newResult</code>.
                    <pre><code>const thrice = (callback, value) => {
  let result = value;

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i += 1) {
    const newResult = callback(result);
  }
};</code></pre>

                    Now we have a loop that invokes the callback, passing in the <code>result</code> variable each time. This works
                    on our first iteration, but we know that on the next iteration, the value of <code>newResult</code> should be
                    passed into our callback. So, let's just give that value to our <code>result</code> variable before moving to
                    that second iteration:
                    <pre><code>const thrice = (callback, value) => {
  let result = value;

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i += 1) {
    const newResult = callback(result);
    result = newResult;
  }
};</code></pre>

                    Now, in the second iteration of our loop, <code>result</code> has the value of the output of the first callback
                    invocation. We pass this value into the callback, and save it to <code>newResult</code>. We then use the value of
                    <code>newResult</code> to overwrite <code>result</code> once again, before moving to the third and final iteration.
                    <br><br>
                    On the last iteration, <code>result</code> has the value of the output of the second invocation, so we pass this
                    into the callback and save it to <code>newResult</code> once again. One final time, we overwrite <code>result</code> with the
                    value of <code>newResult</code>, and then the loop concludes.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, outside of the loop, <code>result</code> is left with the value of the third invocation of the callback.
                    Referring back to our prompt, this is the value we're supposed to return. So, as a final step, let's
                    add that return statement and then run some test cases.
                    <pre><code>const thrice = (callback, value) => {
  let result = value;

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i += 1) {
    const newResult = callback(result);
    result = newResult;
  }

  return result;
};

const divideByTwo = (number) => number / 2;
const concatWithS = (string) => `${string}s`;

console.log(thrice(divideByTwo, 8)); // -> 1
console.log(thrice(concatWithS, 'cat')); // -> catsss</code></pre>

                    We've now finished implementing our function. A higher-order function satisfies at least one of two
                    criteria: accepting a function as an argument, or returning a function as its return value. Like
                    most of the solutions in this guide, <code>thrice</code> fits that first criteria.
                    <br><br>
                    Now that we have a higher-order function, let's take a closer look at callback functions by
                    examining the test cases and the way <code>thrice</code> is invoked.
                    <br><br>
                    In the code snippet above, we have defined our previously-discussed <code>divideByTwo</code> and <code>concatWithS</code>
                    functions. On each invocation of <code>thrice</code>, we pass one of those functions in as the first argument.
                    This means that within the context of those invocations, <code>divideByTwo</code> and <code>concatWithS</code> are callback
                    functions, meaning they have been passed into another function as an argument and then invoked
                    inside that function.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing that's important to note is that we invoke <code>thrice</code>, the callback we pass in is a function</code>
                    object, not a function invocation. There are no parens after the callback's label, because we are
                    not invoking it; we want to pass in the function itself as opposed to the evaluated result of
                    invoking that function.
                    <br><br>
                    Let's walk through exactly how our code runs, using the first test case as an example. First, <code>thrice</code>
                    is invoked. <code>divideByTwo</code> is imported as the value of the parameter <code>callback</code>, and 8 is imported as the
                    value of the parameter <code>value</code>. We then initialize our <code>result</code> variable with <code>value</code>, and enter our <code>for</code>
                    loop. Within this <code>for</code> loop, we invoke <code>callback</code>. This means that we are invoking the function object
                    that was passed in, using <code>result</code> as the argument.
                    <br><br>
                    This next part is the key to understanding higher-order functions: whenever a function is invoked, a
                    new execution context is opened. Look at the line as a whole:
                    <pre><code>const newResult = callback(result);</code></pre>

                    Before we can actually assign a value to <code>newResult</code>, we have to find the value to assign, by
                    evaluating <code>callback(result)</code>. This means that JavaScript will pause execution of the current function
                    thrice, and begin executing <code>callback(result)</code>, which we know to be <code>divByTwo(8)</code>.
                    <br><br>
                    We can now refer to the definition of the currently executing function, <code>divByTwo</code>, where we see that
                    8 is imported as the value of the argument <code>number</code>. We evaluate 8 divided by two, and this result of
                    4 is implicitly returned. When the <code>return</code> keyword is reached in a function, it returns to the
                    previous execution context, in the exact site that the function was called. The value after the
                    <code>return</code> keyword is brought back to that previous context, where it can then be used. So, <code>divByTwo(8)</code>
                    has returned 4 to the previous context, where it is used as the evaluated result of the invocation
                    of <code>divByTwo(8)</code>. It is now equivalent to this:
                    <pre><code>const newResult = 8;</code></pre>

                    From there, this process is repeated; two more calls to <code>divByTwo</code> are made, returning the values of 2
                    and 1 respectively. And each time, JavaScript pauses the execution of <code>thrice</code>, opens a new execution
                    context to evaluate the function call <code>divByTwo(result)</code>, and then returns that evaluated result to
                    the previous context's call site in <code>thrice</code>.
                    <br><br>
                    This process of opening a new context happens every single time a function is invoked, whether
                    that's within the global context of our test case invoking <code>thrice</code>, or within the local context of
                    <code>thrice</code> invoking <code>divByTwo</code>. As we look at more and more higher-order functions and callbacks, it helps
                    to be able to follow the thread of execution from one context to another.
                    <br><br>
                    One final note: function expressions will often be passed directly into a function as a callback
                    argument, without even being saved to a variable first. For example, the following invocations of
                    thrice would also work:
                    <pre><code>console.log(thrice((number) => number / 2, 8)); // -> 1

console.log(thrice(function(string) {
  return `${string}s`
}, 'cat')); // -> catsss</code></pre>

                    In the first example above, we have passed an arrow function expression into <code>thrice</code>. That's the
                    function object that will be imported as the value as the first parameter. The second example may be
                    a little bit less obvious since it spans multiple lines, but we've still just passed an anonymous
                    function expression into <code>thrice</code> as the first argument. The entire function across those three lines
                    is <code>thrice</code>'s first argument, which is why it's followed by a comma separating it from the second
                    argument, 'cat'. Recognizing when a function has been passed in as a callback even if it spans
                    multiple lines is crucial, as this will happen often with higher-order functions.
                    <br><br>
                    This concludes the "First-class Functions" section, which is the basis of understanding all the
                    following challenges in this guide. If you know that functions are just like any other value in
                    JavaScript, if you can identify the syntax patterns that functions can take, and if you're able to
                    effectively follow the thread of execution in a higher-order function like <code>thrice</code>, then you'll be
                    able to fully grasp every single challenge in the CSX Callbacks and Higher Order functions module.
