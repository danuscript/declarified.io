                A callback is a function that gets passed into another function as an argument,
                and then invoked inside that outer function’s body. A higher-order function either
                returns a function, or accepts a callback function as an argument. These two concepts
                seem relatively simple on the surface, but they can be the source of a lot of confusion
                for those who are new to programming. This guide is designed to cut through that confusion,
                by providing clear explanations and easy-to-follow JavaScript code walkthroughs for each
                problem in CSX’s Callbacks & Higher Order Functions module.
                <br><br>
                CSX is an online platform and community where people learn the basics of JavaScript,
                usually to prepare for entrance into the Codesmith coding bootcamp. Many people in this
                community have shared that while they’ve understood the first few sections of CSX
                material, the transition into the Callbacks and Higher Order Functions module has left
                them feeling “discouraged”, “struggling”, “confused”, or “frustrated”. The difficulty spike is
                very real, but these concepts can be broken down into just a few simple patterns. This
                guide is not affiliated with Codesmith or CSX; it’s just here to show you that you can get
                through these challenges with full understanding!
